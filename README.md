If you're using Linux and Docker is already installed, you can use a simple terminal command.
You can navigate to the application directory and start Laravel Sail. Laravel Sail provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration:

`./vendor/bin/sail up -d`

The first time you run the Sail up command, Sail's application containers will be built on your machine. This could take several minutes. Don't worry, subsequent attempts to start Sail will be much faster.

Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can access the application in your web browser at: http://localhost.
